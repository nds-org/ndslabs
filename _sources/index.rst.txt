Labs Workbench
==============

The growing size and complexity of high-value scientific datasets are pushing 
the boundaries of traditional models of data access and discovery. Many large 
datasets are only accessible through the systems on which they were created or 
require specialized software or computational resources.

Labs Workbench is a scalable, web-based platform intended to support turn-key 
deployment of encapsulated data management and analysis tools to support 
exploratory analysis and development near research datasets.
