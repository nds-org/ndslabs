This is the main repository for the [National Data Service](http://www.nationaldataservice.org/) [Labs Workbench](http://www.nationaldataservice.org/platform/workbench.html) service.  

Labs Workbench is an experimental space for evaluating, developing, and exploring interoperability between research data management services. This is achieved through the use of applications containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/whatisk8s/) for container orchestration, deployed on an [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) cluster.

For more information, see the [architecture documentation](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/NDS/Workbench+Architecture).

On top of this foundation, NDS Labs provides a user interface, command line interface, and an API server used to manage the configuration and deployment of containerized services. This repository includes the following:

* apiserver: REST API server, a thin management layer over etcd and Kubernetes as well as the ndslabsctl command line utility
* gui: Project management UI implemented in AngularJS


# Service catalog 
The Labs Workbench includes a catalog of service specifications managed via
the [ndslabs-specs](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-specs) repository. The catalog currenty contains over 50 services (and growing).

# For developers

The Labs Workbench is a hosted service and is not intended for installation. For Labs Workbench developers, it is possible to run the complete system on a single virtual machine or laptop. 

* To run a development copy of Labs Workbench, see https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-startup.
* To deploy Labs Workbench via Ansible on an OpenStack cluster, see https://github.com/nds-org/deploy-tools
