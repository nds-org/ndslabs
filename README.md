This is the main repository for the [National Data Service](http://www.nationaldataservice.org/) [NDS Labs](http://labsportal.nationaldataservice.org/) initiative.  

NDS Labs is designed to be an experimental space for developing and exploring interoperability between services. This is achieved through the use of services containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/whatisk8s/) for container orchestration, deployed on an [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) cluster.

For more information, see the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs/tree/master/docs/architecture).

On top of this foundation, NDS Labs provides a user interface, command line interface, and an API server used to manage the configuration and deployment of containerized services. This repository includes the following:

* apiserver: NDS Labs REST API server, a thin management layer using etcd, Kubernetes, and optional OpenStack APIs.
* gui: Project management UI implemented in AngularJS
* apictl: Command line utility (ndslabsctl)

# System requirements

* For developers, NDS Labs services can run on any system with Docker 1.9+.
* For production deployment, NDS Labs assumes an OpenStack cluster

# Service catalog

NDS Labs includes a catalog of service specifications managed via
the [ndslabs-specs](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-specs) repository.
For more information, see the [service catalog](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/NDS/NDS+Labs+Service+Specification) documentation.

Currently supported services include:
* Clowder (Clowder, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, extractors)
* Dataverse (Dataverse, Rserve, Solr, Postgres, TwoRavens, iRods)
* iRods (iCAT, Cloudbrowser)
* ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana)

# Getting started

See the [setup documentation](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs/blob/master/docs/setup.md) for instructions on starting NDS Labs services.

See the [developer tutorial](https://github.com/nds-org/developer-tutorial) for instructions on running and developing services for NDS Labs.
